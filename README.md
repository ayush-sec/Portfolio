# 👋 Hey, I'm Ayush  

💻 **14 y/o Cybersecurity Explorer** | 🔐 **Red Team Enthusiast (in training)** | ⚙️ **Breaking things to understand how they work**

## 🧠 About Me
I’m not a college student — I’m a **high-schooler who builds, breaks, and experiments** to understand real cybersecurity mechanics.  
I explore systems from the inside out: writing **Bash scripts**, **C programs**, and diving into **Linux + networking** to learn how computers really think.  

> 🚀 My goal: learn cybersecurity the hard way — by actually building and testing things, not just reading about them.

## 🔍 Current Focus
- Building **C projects** to master logic and system behavior  
- Writing **automation scripts** in Bash  
- Learning **networking, system internals, and basic exploitation** concepts  
- Creating small **real-world inspired security tools**
