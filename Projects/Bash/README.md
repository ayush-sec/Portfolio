# 🐚 Bash Scripting Projects

This folder contains a collection of **Bash scripts** I created while learning shell scripting fundamentals.  
Each subfolder focuses on a specific concept — from variables and user input to file operations and conditional logic.

## 💤 Current Status
Currently, this section is **on pause** as I’m focusing on **C programming** to build a deeper understanding of low-level logic and system behavior.  
New Bash scripts will be added soon as I integrate them into larger automation projects.
