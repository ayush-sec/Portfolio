## üßÆ Basic Calculator (C)

A simple **command-line calculator** written in C that performs basic arithmetic operations ‚Äî addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
This was built as one of my early C practice projects to understand **functions, loops, and conditionals**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Performs **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**
- Uses **functions** to organize logic
- Includes **error handling** for division by zero
- Allows **repeated calculations** with a loop-based ‚ÄúDo you wanna do again?‚Äù prompt

---

### üß† Concepts Used

- Functions (`void calculater()`)
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- User input/output using `scanf()` and `printf()`

### üß© Code Overview

The calculator logic is split into two main parts:

1. `calculater()` ‚Äî handles the math and user input  
2. `main()` ‚Äî controls repetition using a loop  

Each operation is triggered by a **numeric menu**, for example:
