## 🧮 Rock-Paper-Scissor (C)

A simple **command-line calculator** written in C that performs basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
This was built as one of my early C practice projects to understand **functions, loops, and conditionals**.

### ⚙️ Features

- Player vs Computer gameplay  
- Randomized computer choices using `rand()` and `srand(time(0))`  
- Displays whether you **win**, **lose**, or **tie**  
- Simple and minimal command-line interface

### 🧠 Concepts Used

- **Random number generation** (`rand()`, `srand()`, `time()`)  
- **Conditionals** (`if-else` logic to determine outcome)  
- **User input/output** using `scanf()` and `printf()`

### 🧩 Code Overview

1. Prompts user for choice:
Rock
Paper
Scissor  

2. Uses `rand()` to randomly select the computer’s choice  
3. Compares both choices and prints the result  
4. Uses clear comments throughout to explain logic
